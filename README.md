# Russian QWERTY input method for Emacs/Quail

This is a package defining the Russian - QWERTY (aka ЯШЕРТЫ) input mode for [Quail](https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-release/blob/master/lisp/international/quail.el), which is the built-in Emacs input mode maanger.

The Russian QWERTY input method is based on the macOS input method of the same name (which used to be called “Russian Phonetic”):

As a Russian kid growing up in Europe, I never learned to type on the “normal” ЙЦУКЕН layout, and this layout has been a useful convenience for me. It is my hope that it might help someone else in this situation!

## Instructions

Install the package or evaluate `quail-russian-qwerty.el`, and the `russian-qwerty` input method will be available to select via `M-x set-input-method`.
